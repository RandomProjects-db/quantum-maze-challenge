### Development Journey Thread
```
🧵 Thread: How I built Quantum Maze with AI assistance (1/8)

Started with a simple idea: "What if Pac-Man had quantum physics?" 

Amazon Q Developer CLI turned this into reality through conversational programming. Here's the journey... 🚀

#BuildGamesChallenge #AmazonQDevCLI
```

```
2/8 First breakthrough: Superposition walls that flicker between solid/transparent states

Me: "Create walls that exist in quantum superposition"
AI: *generates wave function mathematics + visual effects*

Result: Walls you can phase through with the right power-up! 🌊
```

```
3/8 Next challenge: Making ghosts interesting

Instead of basic chase AI, we created 3 distinct personalities:
🔴 Chasers: A* pathfinding pursuit
🔵 Wanderers: Quantum uncertainty movement  
🟤 Guardians: Territorial patrol patterns

Each feels completely different! 👻
```

```
4/8 The quantum entanglement system blew my mind

AI generated paired qubits with visual connections - collect one, find its partner within 10 seconds for bonus points

The pulsating quantum threads look incredible! 🔗✨
```

```
5/8 Audio was a challenge - no sound assets!

Solution: Procedural audio generation
AI created mathematical waveforms for:
- Harmonic qubit collection tones
- Quantum sweep power-up effects  
- Spatial teleportation sounds

Pure math → beautiful audio! 🎵
```

```
6/8 Time saved by AI assistance: 25+ hours

What used to take days of research + coding now happens in minutes through conversation

This is the future of development - AI as creative partner, not just code generator 🤖✨
```

```
7/8 Technical achievements:
- 2,500+ lines of clean, modular code
- 60 FPS performance with real-time effects
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Educational quantum physics concepts

All through conversational programming! 💻
```

```
8/8 The result: A game that teaches quantum physics through play

```
👻 Meet the Decoherence Ghosts!

Each AI type has unique behavior:
🔴 Chasers hunt you with A* pathfinding
🔵 Wanderers move unpredictably  
🟤 Guardians patrol qubit-rich areas

Which one challenges you most? 🎮

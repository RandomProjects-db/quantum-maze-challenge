# üåü Quantum Notation System - Enhanced!

## ‚ú® Latest Improvements

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Extended Duration**
- **Bell States (Entanglement)**: Now last **2.5 seconds** (was 2.0s)
- **Superposition States**: Now last **2.5 seconds** (was 1.5s)
- **Measurement**: Remains 1.8 seconds
- **Tunneling**: Remains 1.5 seconds

### üìö **Smart Stacking System**
- **Multiple notifications** can appear simultaneously
- **Automatic vertical stacking** - notifications pile on top of each other
- **Smooth repositioning** when notifications expire
- **No overlap** - each equation gets its own space

### üé® **Enhanced Animations**
- **Longer fade-in** (15% of duration) for smoother appearance
- **Longer stable time** (70% of duration) for better readability
- **Smooth interpolation** between stack positions
- **Reduced floating amplitude** (3px instead of 5px) for less distraction

## üéÆ **How It Works**

### **Single Notification**
- Appears in center of screen
- Fades in smoothly over 0.375 seconds (for 2.5s duration)
- Stays stable and readable for 1.75 seconds
- Fades out over 0.375 seconds

### **Multiple Notifications (Stacking)**
- **First notification**: Center position
- **Second notification**: 80 pixels below first
- **Third notification**: 160 pixels below first
- **And so on...**

### **Smart Repositioning**
- When a notification expires, remaining ones smoothly move up
- **8x interpolation speed** for responsive repositioning
- No jarring jumps or overlaps

## üß™ **Testing the Enhancements**

### **Quick Test**
```bash
cd submissions/quantum-maze-challenge
python3 test_quantum_notation.py

# Try these:
# Press 1 rapidly - See superposition equations stack
# Press 2 rapidly - See Bell states stack  
# Press SPACE - Rapid fire test (3 notifications at once)
# Press 1,2,1,2 quickly - See mixed stacking
```

### **In-Game Testing**
```bash
python3 quantum_maze.py

# In game:
# Press Q multiple times quickly - Superposition stacking
# Collect multiple entangled qubits - Bell state stacking
# Mix Q and E presses - Different equation types stacking
```

## üåü **Visual Experience**

### **Before Enhancement**
- Single equation at a time
- 1-1.5 second display
- Equations could overlap if triggered rapidly

### **After Enhancement** ‚ú®
- **Multiple equations simultaneously**
- **2.5 seconds for key educational content**
- **Beautiful vertical stacking**
- **Smooth animations and transitions**
- **No visual conflicts**

## üéØ **Educational Impact**

### **Improved Learning**
- **Longer viewing time** allows players to read and understand equations
- **Multiple concepts** can be displayed simultaneously
- **Visual organization** through stacking prevents confusion
- **Contextual learning** - related equations appear together

### **Better User Experience**
- **No missed notifications** due to rapid gameplay
- **Clear visual hierarchy** with stacking
- **Smooth, professional animations**
- **Non-intrusive** design that enhances rather than blocks gameplay

## üî¨ **Technical Details**

### **Duration System**
```python
# Bell States & Superposition: 2.5 seconds
duration=2.5

# Animation phases:
# Fade in: 0-15% (0.375s)
# Stable: 15-85% (1.75s) 
# Fade out: 85-100% (0.375s)
```

### **Stacking Algorithm**
```python
# Each notification gets a stack position
stack_offset = len(active_notifications) * 80  # 80px spacing

# Smooth repositioning when notifications expire
target_y = notification_index * 80
current_y += (target_y - current_y) * dt * 8  # 8x interpolation speed
```

### **Position Calculation**
```python
# Base position (center screen, moved up for stacking)
base_y = screen_height // 2 - 100

# Final position with stacking and floating
final_y = base_y + stack_position + floating_offset
```

## üèÜ **Why This Makes Your Game Special**
